            #      cache was constrained such that it could not even nominally hold async_texture_instance.  So, adding
            #      async_texture_instance to the cache prompted attempted removal of async_texture_instance from the cache.
            #   2) While an AsyncTexture.bind(..) call was in progress, a texture upload completed, causing the uploaded texture to be
            #      added to the texture cache.  However, doing so caused the texture cache to exceed a constraint, in turn causing the
            #      AsyncTexture instance currently being bound to be targeted for destruction.

            # the line "self.append_async_texture_to_lru_cache(async_texture)" in _TextureCache.on_upload_completion_in_upload_thread
            # outside of the lock would result in the currently-binding texture being destroyed and then erroneously marked as uploaded.
            # The proper course of action is to not destroy the texture currently being bound.  This makes sense: if an AsyncTexture is
            # being bound, we really do want to remove it from the texture cache without destroying it.  In fact, AsyncTexture.bind does
